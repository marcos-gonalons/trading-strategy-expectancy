# trading-strategy-expectancy
This is a tool that allows you to check how your money will increase (or decrease) in the long term for a given trading strategy.
You can tweak the initial balance, the % risk of the account balance you are willing to assume per every trade, the distance in pips of the stop loss and the take profit, the % of positive trades, and how many trades are you going to do per day / week / month.

This will show you, on one hand, whatÂ´s the % of positive trades you need to hit in order to have a positive expectancy on your strategy, and in the other hand how powerful compound interest can be.

Example:
Initial balance: 10.000$
Risk per trade: 2% of the account balance
Take profit distance: 10 pips
Stop loss distance: 15 pips
Trades per day in average: 3
Success rate: 70%

With this values, in 5 years, you would have around 250.000$. A rentability of 2500% over the initial balance of 10.000
